<b>POST /analyze-pr:</b><br>
Accepts GitHub PR details (repo, PR number) and specifies the operation mode. An example request is given below:

```
http://35.192.23.147:8000/analyze-pr?repo_url=https://github.com/caching-tools/next-shared-cache&pr_number=933&opMode=0
```

The request returns a ``"task_id"`` which can be used to check the status and result of the analysis.<br>The state diagram for the analysis process has been illustrated below.<br><br>

<br><br>
  The code for the above is available in <b>analyzerApp/agent.py</b>
</p>
<br><br>
<b>GET /status/<task_id></b>: 
<br>Checks the status of the given analysis ``task_id``. An example request is given below:

```
http://35.192.23.147:8000/status/9a23cc7a-cc99-4471-aacf-c0e0d94927e4
```

The status values range from ``"success"``, ``"pending"`` and ``"failed"``.
<br><br>
<b>GET /results/<task_id></b>: 
<br>Returns the result for the given analysis ``task_id``. An example request is given below:

```
http://35.192.23.147:8000/results/9a23cc7a-cc99-4471-aacf-c0e0d94927e4
```

The nature of the response will be dependent on the Operation Mode specified in the POST request. The different operation modes are:<br><br>
``0``: A balance between analysis and code, both lists out potential issues with the code and also provides the code to fix the issues.<br>
``1``: Less focus on theoretical analysis, it focuses on identifying issues and providing us with the code to solve them.<br>
``2``: More focus on theoretical analysis, providing detailed descriptions of the issues.<br>

<b>Setup and run:</b>
<br>
1. Download the project, and open a terminal on the root folder.<br>
